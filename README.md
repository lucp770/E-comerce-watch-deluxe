# E-commerce-watch-deluxe
This a hipotetical E-commerce page that i developed. The products are not real, and are just there for ilustration.
However, there is a fully functional cart that allows user to add products, calculate the total and send the user to a payment page where the user can pay for the products using cryptocurrency.
I implemented the payment functionality using the goerli test network so there is no real money involved in the payment.


The website is divided as follows:

#main page:

##payment method selection:

Here I included other options besides crypto, however they are not functional because this would require interaction with the paypal API or the API for some credit card system, and this would not be viable to do in this test project.
So if the user atempts to select any of them, a message will show up and tell the user that this payment method is not available.
